Simple Small Angle Calculator in NetBeans Java.
Calculates Distance, Angular size, or Actual size of a distant object given the other 2 values.
Useful in astonomy mostly, can also be used to guage distance of objects (ships for example)
if their actual size is already known.
Since these values are ratios, no units are pre-attached to the values. As long as distance and
actual size are in the same measurment units, the calculations will be correct.
